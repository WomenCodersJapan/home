                Many of us were saddened to hear of the sudden closure of Women Who Code.
                There is a need for an organization to empower diverse women in technology careers in Tokyo and across Japan.

                We are not giving up on this mission.
                Please join us in rebuilding community so that we can empower women in Japan in Software Engineering careers.
